    'nose-hoover': Temperature coupling using a Nose-Hoover extended ensemble.
        The reference temperature and coupling groups are selected as above,

        velocities at each timestep. Reference temperature and coupling groups

        Berendsen coupling, with the same scaling using tau-t, but the

        surface tension is coupled to the x/y dimensions of the box. The first

    'lincs': LINear Constraint Solver. With domain decomposition the parallel
        version P-LINCS is used. The accuracy in set with lincs-order, which
        sets the number of matrices in the expansion for the matrix inversion.
        After the matrix inversion correction the algorithm does an iterative
        correction to compensate for lengthening due to rotation. The number of
        such iterations can be controlled with lincs-iter. The root mean square
        relative constraint deviation is printed to the log file every nstlog
        steps. If a bond rotates more than lincs-warnangle in one step, a
        warning will be printed both to the log file and to stderr.
        LINCS should not be used with coupled angle constraints.
    'shake': SHAKE is slightly slower and less stable than LINCS, but does work
        with angle constraints. The relative tolerance is set with shake-tol,
        0.0001 is a good value for “normal” MD. SHAKE does not support
        constraints between atoms on different decomposition domains, so it can
        only be used with domain decomposition when so-called update-groups are
        used, which is usally the case when only bonds involving hydrogens are
        constrained. SHAKE can not be used with energy minimization.
